  # Use OAuth authentication (single user only)
  # Note: OAuth mode does not require 'delegated_users' field
  # For multi-user crawling, use service account authentication instead

  # Path to OAuth credentials file
  # This should contain the OAuth token JSON (token, refresh_token, client_id, client_secret, etc.)
  # Generate using: python scripts/gdrive/generate_oauth_token.py
  # See docs/gdrive-oauth-setup.md for detailed setup instructions
  # The token will be automatically refreshed and saved back to this file when it expires

  # Days back to crawl (files modified in last N days)
  # Default: 7 days if not specified

  # Permission filtering (optional)
  # Files must be shared with at least one of these to be crawled
  # Default: ['Vectara', 'all'] - only files shared with 'Vectara' group or 'all' (public)
  # Set to empty list [] to disable permission filtering (crawl all accessible files)
  # For personal OAuth accounts, you may want to use an empty list:
  # permissions: []
  permissions:
    - Vectara
    - all

  # Optional: Ray workers for parallel processing (default: 0)
  # 0 = no parallelization, >0 = number of workers
