  # Authentication method: "jwt" or "oauth"
  auth_type: jwt

  # ===== JWT Authentication (Recommended for Production) =====
  # Path to Box JWT config file (downloaded from Box Developer Console)
  # This file contains all necessary credentials including client ID, secret, keys, etc.
  # Can use relative path (e.g., box_config.json) or absolute path
  jwt_config_file: box_config.json

  # ===== OAuth Authentication (Good for Testing) =====
  # Option 1: Use a credentials file (recommended)
  # Can use relative path (e.g., box_oauth_credentials.json) or absolute path
  # oauth_credentials_file: box_oauth_credentials.json

  # Option 2: Specify credentials directly in config (not recommended for security)
  # client_id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
  # client_secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
