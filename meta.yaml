  summary: 'A tool for ingesting content into Vectara from various sources'
  description: |
    Vectara-ingest is an open source Python project that demonstrates how to crawl datasets
    and ingest them into Vectara. It provides a step-by-step guide on building your own crawler
    and some pre-built crawlers for ingesting data from sources such as websites, RSS feeds,
    Jira tickets, Notion notes, Docusaurus documentation sites, Slack, and many others.
